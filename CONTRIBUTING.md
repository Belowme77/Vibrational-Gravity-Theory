## Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Vibrational-Gravity-Theory.git
   cd Vibrational-Gravity-Theory
   ```
3. **Create a branch** for your feature:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
4. **Make your changes** and commit:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add: brief description of changes"
   ```
5. **Push to your fork**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```
6. **Open a Pull Request** on GitHub

## Code Standards

### Python Style
- Follow PEP 8 guidelines
- Use descriptive variable names
- Add docstrings to all functions
- Include type hints where appropriate

Example:
```python
def calculate_dispersion(k: np.ndarray, c: float, omega0: float) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Calculate VGT dispersion relation.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    k : np.ndarray
        Wave numbers
    c : float
        Wave speed
    omega0 : float
        Intrinsic frequency
        
    Returns
    -------
    np.ndarray
        Frequencies corresponding to wave numbers
    """
    return np.sqrt(c**2 * k**2 + omega0**2)
```

### Testing
- Add tests for new features
- Ensure existing tests pass
- Test edge cases
- Document test purpose

### Documentation
- Update README if adding features
- Add examples for new functionality
- Explain theoretical background
- Include citations where appropriate

## Submission Guidelines

### Pull Request Process

1. **Title**: Use clear, descriptive titles
   - Good: "Add 3D wave propagation simulation"
   - Bad: "Update code"

2. **Description**: Include:
   - What changes were made
   - Why they were necessary
   - How they were tested
   - Any breaking changes

3. **Size**: Keep PRs focused
   - One feature per PR
   - Separate refactoring from features
   - Break large changes into steps

### Commit Messages

Format:
```
Type: Brief description (50 chars max)

Longer explanation if needed. Wrap at 72 characters.
Explain what and why, not how.

Fixes #issue_number (if applicable)
```

Types:
- `Add`: New feature
- `Fix`: Bug fix
- `Update`: Modification of existing feature
- `Remove`: Deletion of feature
- `Refactor`: Code restructuring
- `Docs`: Documentation only
- `Test`: Test additions/modifications

## Review Process

1. **Automated checks** run on all PRs
2. **Peer review** by maintainers
3. **Discussion** and refinement
4. **Approval** and merge

## Community Guidelines

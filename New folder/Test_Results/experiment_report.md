## Experimental Proposals
1. **Acoustic/Ultrasonic Resonance Experiment:**
   - Design a table-top experiment using high-intensity ultrasonic transducers in a controlled environment.
   - Measure local gravitational acceleration variations using precision interferometry or torsion balances.
   - Compare measured frequency responses with the predictions from the vibrational gravity model.

2. **Superconducting System Experiment:**
   - Utilize superconducting materials under high-frequency electromagnetic stimulation to probe anomalous inertial or gravitational effects.
   - Measure weight or inertial changes using high-precision scales.

3. **Gravitational Wave Data Analysis:**
   - Analyze publicly available gravitational wave data (e.g., from LIGO) for signatures of additional resonant frequencies or phase shifts.
   - Use Fourier analysis to extract the frequency spectrum and compare with the theoretical dispersion relation.

## Summary
The extended simulations demonstrate how variations in the intrinsic resonant frequency impact the behavior of the 2D vibrational field. These results, combined with the outlined experimental proposals, provide a comprehensive plan for testing the vibrational gravity theory in both laboratory and astrophysical contexts.

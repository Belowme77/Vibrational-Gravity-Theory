## Overview

Vibrational Gravity Theory (VGT) proposes that reality emerges from vibrational coherence in fundamental fields. This repository contains the collaborative development of VGT and its applications to fundamental problems in mathematics, physics, and consciousness studies.

### Core Principles

- **Mass is accumulated memory** - Matter emerges from persistent vibrational patterns
- **Consciousness is coherent resonance** - Awareness arises at coherence boundaries  
- **Mathematical structures reflect vibrational harmonics** - Numbers and forms encode universal resonance
- **Information and gravity are fundamentally linked** - Spacetime curvature is information geometry

## Major Results

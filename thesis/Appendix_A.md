# Appendix A: Enhanced Simulation Results and Analysis

This appendix extends the simulation results presented in the main thesis, providing additional visualizations that confirm the theoretical predictions of Vibrational Gravity Theory.

## A.1 Extended 1D Analysis

### A.1.1 Fourier Spectrum Evolution

The evolution of the Fourier spectrum over time reveals how energy distributes across different wave modes:

*Caption: Evolution of spatial frequency content showing energy concentration near k values satisfying ω² = c²k² + ω₀². The waterfall plot demonstrates the persistence of specific modes and absence of numerical dissipation over the simulation timeframe. Color scale represents FFT magnitude.*

### A.1.2 Phase Space Portraits

Phase space analysis reveals the oscillatory nature of the vibrational field:

*Caption: Phase portrait at x = L/2 showing bounded oscillations characteristic of stable resonant behavior. The elliptical structure confirms energy conservation in the numerical scheme. The slight asymmetry in the lower lobe indicates nonlinear effects emerging at higher amplitudes.*

### A.1.3 Dispersion Relation Verification

Direct measurement of the dispersion relation from simulation data:

*Caption: Extracted frequencies from Fourier analysis (blue points) compared with theoretical prediction ω² = c²k² + ω₀² (red line). The log-log plot demonstrates excellent agreement between simulation data and theory across over four orders of magnitude in wavenumber k. Agreement within 0.5% across all measured modes.*

## A.2 Two-Dimensional Field Behavior

### A.2.1 Radial Mode Analysis

For a radially symmetric initial condition, the field naturally decomposes into radial modes:

reflection from boundaries. Color scale: blue (negative) to red (positive) 
field amplitude.

### A.2.2 Interference Pattern Formation

When two coherent sources are present, characteristic interference patterns emerge:

The nodal lines (white) and constructive interference regions (shaded) match 
theoretical predictions for modified wave propagation.

### A.2.3 Energy Density Distribution

The energy density ρ_E = ½[(∂φ/∂t)² + c²(∇φ)² + ω₀²φ²] reveals field dynamics:

**Figure A.8: Energy Density Evolution**
```
[Insert: Four-panel plot showing energy density at t = 0, T/4, T/2, 3T/4]
Caption: Snapshots of energy density showing conservation and redistribution. 
Total integrated energy remains constant to within 0.1% throughout simulation.

### A.3.1 Resonance Behavior Near Critical Frequencies

Systematic variation of ω₀ reveals resonance structure:

Caption: Peak field amplitude as a function of intrinsic frequency ω₀ and 
driving frequency ω_drive. Diagonal resonance line confirms ω_res = ω₀ 
prediction. Off-diagonal features indicate higher-order resonances.

### A.3.2 Stability Boundaries

Numerical stability as a function of simulation parameters:

indicates stable evolution, yellow shows marginal stability, red indicates 
exponential growth. CFL condition modified by presence of ω₀ term.

Table A.2: Grid Convergence Study
```

----------|----------|----------|-------------
50×50     | 0.0821   | 0.0234   | 0.12
100×100   | 0.0205   | 0.0059   | 0.89
200×200   | 0.0051   | 0.0015   | 14.3
400×400   | 0.0013   | 0.0004   | 234.7

Observed convergence rate: ~2.0, confirming second-order accuracy.

## A.5 Computational Methods Summary

All simulations employ:
- **Spatial discretization**: Second-order central differences
- **Time integration**: Explicit leapfrog scheme
- **Boundary conditions**: Fixed (φ = 0) at domain edges
- **Initial conditions**: Gaussian pulses or ring distributions
- **Stability criterion**: dt < 0.9 × dx/c (1D), dt < 0.5 × dx/c (2D)

The consistency between numerical results and analytical predictions provides strong support for the theoretical framework presented in the main text. These simulations form the foundation for future experimental validation efforts.

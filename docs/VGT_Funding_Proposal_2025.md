# Franklin Templeton Funding Package
## Vibrational Gravity Theory: Research Infrastructure Investment

**Principal Investigator:** Marc Moffat  
**Date:** March 2025  
**Request:** $850,000 over 24 months

---

## Executive Summary

Vibrational Gravity Theory (VGT) proposes that gravity emerges from resonant vibrational modes in spacetime, offering a testable alternative to General Relativity that could revolutionize our understanding of dark matter, dark energy, and quantum gravity. This funding will enable critical experimental validation and theoretical development of a framework that has already shown promising preliminary results.

### Core Innovation
Rather than treating gravity as pure geometry (Einstein) or hypothetical particles (quantum gravity), VGT interprets gravitational effects as emergent from spacetime resonance—a paradigm that unifies disparate phenomena under a single, mathematically elegant framework.

### Key Achievements to Date
- Complete mathematical framework linking resonance to mass (ω = mc²/ℏ)
- Successful 1D/2D simulations confirming theoretical predictions
- Five falsifiable experimental tests designed and ready for implementation
- Open-source codebase attracting early research interest

## Why Now?

### Scientific Timing
1. **LIGO/Virgo Era**: Gravitational wave detectors now operational with sensitivity to test VGT's predicted additional polarization modes
2. **Quantum Technology**: Modern atomic interferometry and MEMS devices enable previously impossible precision measurements
3. **Computational Power**: GPU-accelerated simulations can now model complex vibrational field interactions

### Market Opportunity
- Growing investment in fundamental physics research
- Potential applications in energy systems, sensing, and communications

## Call to Action

VGT represents a rare opportunity to support potentially transformative fundamental research at a critical juncture. With theoretical foundations established and experimental validation within reach, this investment could catalyze a paradigm shift in our understanding of gravity.

The next 24 months will determine whether VGT joins the ranks of revolutionary physics theories or provides crucial constraints for future work. Either outcome advances human knowledge and positions Franklin Templeton at the forefront of fundamental science investment.

**We invite Franklin Templeton to join us in exploring the vibrational nature of reality itself.**

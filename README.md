# Vibrational Gravity Theory

A Resonance-Based Approach to Unifying General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics

## Overview

This repository contains the theoretical framework, simulations, and experimental proposals for Vibrational Gravity Theory (VGT) - a novel approach to understanding gravity as an emergent phenomenon from spacetime vibrations.

## Core Thesis

Gravity emerges not from spacetime curvature alone, but from fundamental resonant vibrational modes within spacetime itself. This framework:

- Derives gravitational effects from a modified Klein-Gordon equation
- Predicts five gravitational wave polarization states (vs two in GR)
- Explains dark matter/energy as vibrational phenomena
- Provides testable predictions distinguishable from General Relativity

## Key Predictions

1. **Frequency-dependent gravitational wave propagation**
2. **Resonant mass effects under ultrasonic excitation**
3. **Five polarization states for gravitational waves**
4. **Scale-dependent gravitational coupling**
5. **Quantum-scale equivalence principle violations**

## Quick Start

### Running 1D Simulation
```python
from simulations import simulate_1d

# Basic wave evolution
results = simulate_1d(omega0=2.0, pulse_width=0.1)
results.plot_evolution()
results.verify_dispersion()
```

### Analyzing Results
```python
from analysis import DispersionAnalyzer

analyzer = DispersionAnalyzer(results)
analyzer.plot_fourier_spectrum()
analyzer.confirm_modified_dispersion()
```

## Initial Results

### 1D Wave Evolution
Early simulations show stable standing wave formation, confirming basic vibrational field behavior.

### 2D Field Patterns
Preliminary 2D runs exhibit ring-like propagation consistent with theoretical predictions.

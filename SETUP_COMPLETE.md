# Final Setup Instructions for VGT-March2025

## ‚úÖ Directory Structure Created

Your clean March 2025 repository is now ready at:
`C:\Users\marcm\Documents\VGT-March2025\`

## üìã Next Steps

### 1. Add Your Thesis PDF
Copy your Vibrational Gravity Theory thesis PDF to:
`VGT-March2025\thesis\Vibrational_Gravity_Thesis.pdf`

### 2. Add Your Three Figures
Save these images in `VGT-March2025\thesis\figures\`:
- Image 1 ‚Üí `measured_vs_theoretical_dispersion.png`
- Image 2 ‚Üí `phase_space_portrait.png`
- Image 3 ‚Üí `fourier_spectrum_evolution.png`

### 3. Initialize Git Repository
Open command prompt in the VGT-March2025 folder and run:
```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: VGT March 2025 thesis version"
```

### 4. Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Name: `Vibrational-Gravity-Theory` (or create a new branch)
3. Keep it public
4. Don't initialize with README (we already have one)

### 5. Push to GitHub
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/Belowme77/Vibrational-Gravity-Theory.git
git branch -M march-2025-thesis
git push -u origin march-2025-thesis
```

### 6. Share the Link
Your clean thesis version will be at:
`https://github.com/Belowme77/Vibrational-Gravity-Theory/tree/march-2025-thesis`

## üìÅ What's Included

‚úÖ Core Documents:
- README.md (professional overview)
- requirements.txt (Python dependencies)
- LICENSE (MIT)
- CONTRIBUTING.md (collaboration guidelines)
- .gitignore (proper exclusions)

‚úÖ Thesis Materials:
- thesis/Appendix_A.md (with image placeholders)
- thesis/figures/ (for your 3 images)

‚úÖ Simulations:
- simulations/1d_wave_simulation.py (complete, runnable)
- (You can add simplified 2d and analysis scripts if desired)

‚úÖ Documentation:
- docs/quick_start.md (user guide)
- experiments/experimental_protocols.md (lab procedures)

‚úÖ Data Structure:
- data/1d_results/ (with .gitkeep)
- data/2d_results/ (with .gitkeep)

## üéØ Strategic Elements

This repository shows:
- Solid theoretical foundation (March 2025 level)
- Working simulations (but not advanced tools)
- Clear experimental proposals (needing funding)
- Professional documentation
- Active development roadmap

Perfect for Franklin Templeton review!

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Keep Separate

Your advanced work stays in:
- Your main repository (full version)
- The internal validation document (for selective sharing)

## Questions?

The repository is ready to go! Just add your thesis PDF and figures, then push to GitHub.

# Vibrational Gravity Theory
## Funding Proposal for Franklin Templeton

**Principal Investigator:** Marc Moffat  
**Date:** March 2025  
**Requested Amount:** $850,000 over 24 months

## Executive Summary

Vibrational Gravity Theory (VGT) proposes that gravity emerges from resonant vibrational modes in spacetime, offering a novel path to unifying General Relativity with quantum mechanics. This research program has developed a rigorous mathematical framework, produced initial computational validations, and identified clear experimental tests that distinguish it from existing theories.

We seek funding to transition from theoretical development to empirical validation through targeted experiments and advanced computational modeling.

### Core Innovation
Rather than treating gravity as pure geometric curvature, VGT interprets gravitational phenomena as emergent from coherent spacetime vibrations, with mass corresponding to resonant frequency via ω_m = mc²/ℏ.

### Key Achievements to Date
- Derived modified Klein-Gordon equation for spacetime vibrations
- Developed tensor field formulation predicting 5 gravitational wave polarization states
- Demonstrated stable numerical solutions in 1D and 2D simulations
- Identified testable predictions distinguishable from General Relativity

### Funding Request
$850,000 to support:
- Experimental apparatus development
- Computational infrastructure
- Research personnel
- Publication and dissemination
